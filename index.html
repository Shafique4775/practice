<ul><li>HTML pages are text documents.</li>
<li><b> HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) </b> to give the information they surround special meaning.</li>
<li><i> Tags are often referred to as elements.</i></li>
  <!-- To use <strong> to Text having importance  & Emphasis by using <em>   -->
<li><strong> Tags usually come in pairs. </strong> The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.</li>
<li><em> Opening tags can carry attributes, </em> which tell us more about the content of that element. </li>
<li>Attributes require a name and a value.</li>
<li>To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.</li></ul>
